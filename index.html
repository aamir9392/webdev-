 <h2>ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION student</h2>
 <h3>
     <span>I started learning coding after watching videos on web development. It had a great impact on me to love web and app development.Most of my free time I try to look up different video tutorials on YouTube. After understanding the code line by line, I try to code on my own. I have good knowledge about web development and I want to upskill as I move forward.
        Currently I've created my own portfolio, completed projects assigned by HackClub, successfully completed few courses on web development. I consider this as a huge opportunity to learn React, which is very rare.</span></h3>
